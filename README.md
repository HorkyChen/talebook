# Tale Book: Personal Calibre WebServer
A enhanced personal books management webserver built on Calibre + Vue, beautiful and easy-to-use. ([中文说明](document/README.zh_CN.md))

**Noted: Online publishing is prohibited for personal websites in China. This project is recommended for personal use only!**

## Road Map

    1. Updated to Calibre 7.6, system uses Ubuntu 24.04.
    2. Added information reset functionality in management, updated when scraping occurs
* v3.10.0
    1. Introduce book export functionality (e.g., converting epub to azw3 for Kindle use)
* NEXT
    1. Support for information sharing

## Introduction
Tale Book is a simple yet powerful personal book management system based on Calibre, supporting **online reading**. Key features include:
* **Beautiful and intuitive UI**: The default Calibre web interface is unattractive and difficult to use. Tale Book introduces a new interface built with Vue, optimized for both PC and mobile browsing.
* **Multi-user support**: Enables multi-user functionality for easier management, supporting login via ~~Douban~~ (deprecated), QQ, Weibo, GitHub, and other social platforms.
* **Online reading**: Allows users to read eBooks online using the [epub.js](https://github.com/intity/epubreader-js) library (chapter review functionality is under development).
* **Batch scanning and importing**: Quickly scan and import books into the library.
* **Email push**: Easily send books to Kindle devices.
* **OPDS support**: Compatible with apps like [KyBooks](http://kybook-reader.com/) for convenient reading.
* **One-click installation**: Provides web-based initialization for effortless website setup.
* **Optimized file storage**: Supports categorization by letter or retaining Chinese filenames for large libraries.
* **Quick book information updates**: Enables importing basic book information from Baidu Encyclopedia and Douban searches.
* **Private mode**: Requires an access code to enter the website, ideal for sharing within small groups.

This project was formerly known as `calibre-webserver`.
